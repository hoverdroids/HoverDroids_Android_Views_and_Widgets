        the same direction will result in wrongly scaled images.  If you wish to do this, place one layout in values
        and a duplicate in values-land. Then, set one orientation in each (e.g. in values set scrollDirectionPort="vertical"
        and int values-land set scrollDirectionLand="vertical".</string>
